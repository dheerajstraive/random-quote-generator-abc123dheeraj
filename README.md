## Customization

### Fetching Quotes from an API

If you wish to fetch quotes from a public API:

1. Identify a suitable API that provides quotes, such as [Quotable](https://quotable.io).

2. Modify the JavaScript code in `index.html` to fetch and display quotes from the chosen API. 

3. Ensure any API keys (if required) are kept secure and are not embedded directly in your client-side code.

### Tweaking the Design

You can enhance or modify the appearance of the application by updating the CSS directly in `index.html` or linking to an external stylesheet.
